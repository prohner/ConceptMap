Thought Cloud is the bridge between mind mapping and network diagramming.

In the old days, we used desktop products to layout a network diagram.  And the screens weren't big enough. You've been stuck in two dimensions. Add depth and reality to your mind maps and network diagrams.

Start with a desktop and toss some thoughts on there.  Add pictures to your thoughts.  Give them depth by putting a thought inside another thought.  Connect thoughts by labeling a line on the desktop between the thoughts.  Move the thoughts around and the sticky connection lines follow the thoughts.

"Thought box"

Thought Boxes have a lot of customizability.  Tap to change colors, shapes and fonts and keep tapping until you like what you see. (Changes happen immediately and visibly)

Email a picture of the Thought Cloud desktop.  Thought Cloud can even transform your cloud into an indented list through email.  

Cette application a également une option de langue française. Merci à Yves Accad pour la traduction.
