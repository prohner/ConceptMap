last night i dreamt that me and a bunch of buddies had a plan to kill tom flynn. i had nothing against him but apparently david did. david came up with a whole a plan. i was hiding in the bushes and was waiting to alert david and jared for tom. while i was waiting in the bushes i saw a man messing with trick-or-treaters and set up road blocks on the end of the street. an 18-year-old girl was being chased by her boyfriend and she jumped into the bush that i was in. i asked her, "where have i seen you before?" she said that it was at the water park i was at yesterday where i finished the obstacle course that no one had finished before. when we saw tom flynn me and the girl jumped into my stepmom's toyota sequoia and sean was waiting there. in this car the pedals for gas and brake were on the right but the steering wheels were also on the left. sean and i were driving while the girl was in the backseat. sean and i drove through the culdasack and than got to the roadblock where that man was messing with trick or treaters. sean the girl and i all got out of the car and went out into the farmers market and stole a car. we looped around the neighborhood a couple time and then went back to my house. david was excited because they had killed tom. then i was following my 2 year old brother chase in a ride in hurricane harbor and when we got out i saw jared david sean and the girl. me mom the girl and the rest of the gang went to a diner and discussed what happened and then we met up with the guy that was messing with the trick-or-treaters and he was trying to kill me the whole time. he setup the roadblock so i could run into it and then he had a hand grenade and cooked it and then he tried to tackle sean but he got me and i dodged the grenade. then the guy left and me and david had a flashback of the event and saw it all happen. and then my dad woke me up.
